## Redis Development

When writing, reviewing, or debugging code that uses Redis:
1. Use the `get_best_practice` tool to check relevant patterns
2. Use the `get_anti_patterns` tool to avoid common mistakes  
3. Use the `get_code_example` tool for production-ready snippets

Always consult Redis best practices for: connection pooling, key naming,
data structure selection, memory management, and security.
